 * Each presenter should have attach()/detach() or (bind/unbind) methods to bind the view
 * to the presenter. If an asynchronous job is done we have to check if view is attached or not.
 * So we also need a isAttached()method.
 *
 * Also view is defined as generic class extends BaseView.
 * By doing this we tell the presenter that it should attach a view that extends the BaseView.
